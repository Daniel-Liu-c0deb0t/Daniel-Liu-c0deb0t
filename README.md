### Greetings, curious internet dweller! ðŸ‘‹

This is the home of most of my code. Take a look around--something may catch your eye!

If you are curious about me, then here are a few fun facts:

- I'm a first-year undergrad at UCLA.
- I am a big fan of open source and open science!
- I like fast code. Anything from micro-optimizations to elegant new algorithms is fair game for me.
- I mainly code Rust, Java, and Python, in a minimalist Vim setup. Who needs an IDE?
- I'm always looking for interesting new projects to get into. Reach out to me at `danielliu (at) liudaniel.com` or on Twitter! I'm always down to chat.

If you are extraordinarily bold and curious, check out this cool [project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) that has been piquing my interest recently.
